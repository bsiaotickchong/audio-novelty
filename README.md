# audio-novelty
Based on papers about automatic audio segmentation using a measure of audio novelty

## Motivation
This was made for a final project in a computational audio class in Spring 2017 in collaboration with professor Wayne Snyder at Boston University. Motivation for the methods are in several papers referenced below.

## Running this code
- install Jupyter Notebook (comes with the Anaconda distribution)
- parameters are adjustable at the beginning of Part 1 and may effect run time
- you can try your own music by adding it to the "music/" folder and making the "title" variable the name of the file (must be .wav)

## Notes
- code is documented and heavily based off of papers referenced below, and can be used as a learning tool
- the .mp4 file is an example rendering of the last code cell in the iPython notebook
- a more detailed description/analysis is in the final report pdf
- cs591utilities.py and parts of Part 1 in novelty_scores.ipynb are provided by Wayne Snyder
- music provided in repository is NOT owned by me, and is purely meant for educational purposes (necessary for running the code)
