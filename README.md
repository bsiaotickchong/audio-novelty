# audio-novelty
Based on papers about automatic audio segmentation using a measure of audio novelty

## Motivation
This was made for a final project in a computational audio class in Spring 2017. Motivation for the methods are in several papers, such as this paper titled Automatic Audio Segmentation Using a Measure of Audio Novelty: https://www.fxpal.com/publications/automatic-audio-segmentation-using-a-measure-of-audio-novelty.pdf

## Running this code
- install Jupyter Notebook (comes with the Anaconda distribution)
- parameters are adjustable at the beginning of Part 1 and may effect run time
- you can try your own music by adding it to the "music/" folder and making the "title" variable the name of the file (must be .wav)

## Notes
- code is documented and heavily based off of the papers
- the .mp4 file is an example rendering of the last code cell in the iPython notebook
- a more detailed description/analysis is in the final report pdf

- see final report pdf
